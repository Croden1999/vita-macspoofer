# macspoofer
A plugin to spoof your MAC address __in the System Information__ with advanced options

This was more of a fun project for me as hiding one's MAC doesn't make much sense anymore but was quite popular in the PSP days. __This will not change your actual MAC address and doesn't spoof it system wide or in your Network obviously!__

*I still think plugins should have the ability to register their options to the HENkaku settings so we would have all plugin's options in one noobfriendly place.*


## Installation
1) Add *macspoofer.suprx* to `ur0:tai/config.txt` under `*NPXS10015` and `*NPXS10016`
2) Reboot or reload tai config in HENkaku settings
3) Adjust spoofing options under 'Security' Tab in the Settings App
4) Profit!


## Notes
 - Limited functionality for PSTV users as 'Security' tab doesn't exist.
