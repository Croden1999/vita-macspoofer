A plugin to spoof your MAC address in the System Information with advanced options

This was more of a fun project for me as hiding one's MAC doesn't make much sense anymore but was quite popular in the PSP days.

## Installation
1) Add *macspoof.suprx* to `ur0:tai/config.txt` under \*NPXS10015 and \*NPXS10016
2) Reboot or reload tai config in HENkaku settings
3) Adjust spoofing options under 'Security' Tab in the Settings App
4) Profit!


## Notes
 - Limited functionality for PSTV users as 'Security' tab doesn't exist.
 
*I still think plugins should have the ability to register their options to the HENkaku settings so we would have all plugin's options in one noobfriendly place.*
